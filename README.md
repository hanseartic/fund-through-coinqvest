# Fund me through coinqvest
A simple one-pager that allows receiving payments through [coinqvest.com](https://coinqvest.com).

This is a small nextjs app, that highlights selected projects on a given github-account. Interaction with the
coinqvest merchant API is done server-side so your credentials don't get exposed.
